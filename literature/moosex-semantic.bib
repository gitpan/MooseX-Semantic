  abstract = {Using ontologies in software applications is a challenging task due
	to the chasm between the logics-based world of ontologies and the
	object-oriented world of software applications. The logics-based
	representation emphasizes the meaning of concepts and properties,
	i.e., their semantics. The modeler in the object-oriented paradigm
	also takes into account the pragmatics, i.e., how the classes are
	used, by whom, and why. To enable a comprehensive use of logics-based
	representations in object-oriented software systems, a seamless integration
	of the two paradigms is needed. However, the pragmatic issues of
	using logic-based knowledge in object-oriented software applications
	has yet not been considered sufficiently. Rather, the pragmatic issues
	that arise in using an ontology, e.g., which classes to instantiate
	in which order, remains a task to be carefully considered by the
	application developer. In this paper, we present a declarative representation
	for designing and applying programming access to ontologies. Based
	on this declarative representation, we have build OntoMDE, a model-driven
	engineering toolkit that we have applied to several example ontologies
	with different Characteristics.},
